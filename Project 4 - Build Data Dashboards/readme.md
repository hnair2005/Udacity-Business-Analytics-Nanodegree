## Project 4 - Build Data Dashboards

In this project, visualizations will be created to reveal insights from a data set. These data visualizations should tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set, as a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication. The visualization work should use Tableau.

**Dataset - Flight Delays and Cancellations**
