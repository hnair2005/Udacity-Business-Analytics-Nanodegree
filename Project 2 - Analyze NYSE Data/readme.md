## Project 1 - Working with Data

The project involved using Excel to model real life data from the New York Stock Exchange using a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. 

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to:

- interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range)
- use a combination of Excel functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, drop downs, data validation, VLOOKUP).
- analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Excel or Google Sheets.
- create visualizations of a business metric and use Excel or Google Sheets to create a financial forecast model.
